"Sidney Barrington “Barry” Gates was a scientist, an artist, a father and a friend. During his lifetime he wrote over 150 journal articles in the aerodynamic field, multiple collections of poetry, short plays,and contributed to various magazines as a book critic. He did not just excel in one area of his life, but all of them. He was continuously described as a kind and loyal friend who always put others first, which is no surprise when looking at his areas of research in pilot safety and plane stability. He is also remembered as an extremely intelligent and creative man, who had an elegant way with words. Torn between a love of literature and mathematics throughout his life, he made lasting contributions to both fields. His writing could range from poetically describing the human experience and its trials and tribulations to creatively solving the aerodynamic fields next big issue. Barry Gates was born in Watton, England in 1893 to Ernest Edwin Gates and his wife, whosename is unknown. The two had three children, Barrington, and two younger daughters.  His father was a respected banker at Barclays Bank in the small market town of Watton. There is not much writing from Gates’ ownautobiography or other biographies about his life that  includes his younger years, however, it is known that he lost his mother at the age of eleven. Following the death of his wife Gates’ father, Ernest, and his three children relocated to Norwich, where Ernest Gates received a job at the head office of Barclays Bank in Bank Plain,  Norwich (Boyles 181). This move led to the beginning of Gates' education at Higham Grammar School. In school, Gates excelled in academic as well as athletics. Although he suffered from a stutter, this did not stop him from pursuing his education. His teachers noticed his affinity for mathematics and masters of the subject took him under their wing. Gates says in his unfinished autobiography, “Mathematics is unique in its impact on the young. You either muddle along for  a time with a lot of nonsensical ideas about how you are meant to use it, then give it up, or you  suddenly see the light, after which you are alright, or at least as right as your intellectual capacity  will allow” (Boyles 182). This natural ability as well as his love for math propelled him to excel  in his examinations from the newly renamed The City of Norwich School. He received top  honors in his exams and earned a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1911. He  chose to pursue a degree in mathematics, however he says that “but for the urging of his  schoolmasters he himself would have opted for an art subject” (Boyles 183). Gates’ love of  words and literature and his abilities in the sciences continued to be in constant competition  throughout his life.   Gates thoroughly enjoyed his time at Corpus Christi, stating in his autobiography that his “years at Corpus lifted me into a happiness I had never known in my childhood and have rarely known since” (Boyles 183). He thrived in an academic setting with his peers going after the same things he was. He reveled in the thought that there were infinite possibilities for where his life could take him. To him, academics were a place where people young and old could come together in the search for truth and knowledge, a place where people were eager to learn from one another as well as from themselves. Following examinations from Corpus Christi, he was awarded a Wranglership (otherwise known as highest honors at Cambridge). While his courses at Corpus Christi College were strictly mathematics and science related, he received a college prize for exams and chose to works of English writers and poets such as Christina Rossetti, Robert Browning, William Blake, Francis Thompson, Alice Meynell and William Ernest Henley as his reward. It’s evident that these artist’s romantic and devotional poetry had a large impact on his own poetry and further propelled his interest in the literary arts. As most other young men did after university, Barry Gates joined the army following graduation from Corpus Christi in 1914. However, this was one aspect of his life that he did not excel in or enjoy, stating “after looking at my puttees and certain other aspects of my military bearing under training, the Army came to the correct decision about me: This man is no good for us. Let him go do the sums he is said to be good at”. In 1915 he was offered employment at the Royal Aircraft Factory (now known as the Royal Aircraft Establishment). He was recruited by the Chief Engineer F.M. Green who noticed his huge capabilities for math and saw potential for what he could do for the aerodynamic field. Through the R.A.F, Gates was introduced to many intellectuals in the same field that helped drive him into the field even more. Names such as Geoffrey Taylor, Hermann Glauert and Frederick Lindemann, were great friends of his who all went on to accomplish great things in the physics and mathematics fields as well (Boyles 184). It was in this academic setting that Barrington Gates thrived and could fully explore the furthest reaches of his imagination and intellect in solving the next big problem in flight safety. While aerodynamics may have taken over the majority of his adult life, Gates also explored his love of poetry in his younger years. His literary career began by having selections of his poems published in magazines such as Windsor Magazine, The Westminster Gazette, and The New Witness. Following the success of these selections, B.H. Oxford published Barrington Gates’ first whole collection of poetry in 1918, which is entitled Cargo. Cargo had two major themes: the anguish and loss that comes along with war and death, and the beauty and healing  powers that nature holds. This beautiful contrast is a common theme seen throughout his  collection of poetry. The loss of his mother at a young age and his own short experience in the  army seems to be the origin of his poetry about loss and bereavement. Working with the R.A.F.  also led to a few poems being written about airplanes and their pilots, though this is only a small  percentage in his collection. In these, he mainly focuses on the relationship between plane and  pilot. With his focus on pilot safety and stability, it’s no surprise that his poetry also shared this  devotion.   Cargo was not the beginning and end of his literary career. In 1925, Leonard and Virginia Woolf’s Hogarth Press published a collection of his poems entitled Poems. The total number of copies sold is unknown, however by January of 1926, over 60 copies had been sold of this collection (Woolmer’s Checklist). While not widely successful, certain selections from this collection were also printed in magazines such as The London Mercury, The New Statesman, The Nation and the Athenaeum, The Westminster Gazette, The Poetry Review and The New Highway. This collection of poems focuses more on the human experience and emotions while intertwining the importance of nature. Growing up, Gates and his two sisters spent holidays at their paternal grandparents house. Their grandfather had a large conservatory and greenhouse, which sparked Gates’ own love of gardening and experiencing the outdoors. Gates’ expressive use of nature in the poem “Abnormal Psychology” from Poems demonstrates this love: With all that’s brave beneath the sun, With lovers’ singing, and tall great trees, And the white glory of morning seas. Wilson 5 what of this silence, so there stay, Child’s laughter to the end of the day? And what of dark, if on the hill Eve is burning opal still? Poems was the last collection of poems that Gates published, but he went on to write a series of short plays entitled The Mulligatawny Medallion in 1926. This seemed to be the end of his career as a poet, however he went on to write as a book critic for magazines like The Nation (192328), The New Statesman (192545), and The Times Literary Supplement from 1928 until almost the end of his life. While he had a short career as a poet and playwright, his love for the subject did not fade. In addition to all of the commitments that came along with his career in the aerodynamic field, he still found time to write for magazines on the side and keep up with new works by authors in England. Sidney Barrington Gates thrived in any academic setting. Whether it was writing research  for scientific journals or his own poetry, his mastery of words shone through in everything he  did. The Hogarth Press represented a great starting point for many new and unknown authors,  and this was no different for Gates. While his poetry was not widely distributed or known, the  impact he had in the scientific world was partly due to his presence in the literary world as well.  He’s remembered as a goodnatured man, who lived his life to further improve others’ life  through his research and poetry.",Hayley Wilson,,1893,1973,"Scientist, Aviation Consultant, Man of Letters",Male,Barrington Gates,http://viaf.org/viaf/192296383,,Watton,GB,,,,BarringtonGates.jpeg,Portrait of Barrington Gates,"H.

"Charles Davies was a Welsh-born writer, poet, and lecturer.  He was born in 1901 in Penclawdd, Glamorganshire.  He began his studies at the University College, Aberystwyth. In October of 1924, Davies was admitted to Jesus College in Oxford where he pursued his Master’s degree in Education which he completed with distinction in June of 1925 (Jesus College Oxford Archives RE.AD.6, leaf 99). After graduating, Davies was appointed probationary assistant lecturer in English at University College, Bangor on June 23, 1926.
Charles Davies’ novel, Welshman’s Way, appeared at the Hogarth Press in 1927, a year after his professorship started. At this time, the Woolfs were publishing the works of working class authors (Southworth (2012), 218). The Woolfs printed one thousand copies of Davies’ book in cream paper wrappers in brown and green (Woolmer, 46). According to the David H. Porter’s Omega Workshops and the Hogarth Press, Davies’ novel was intended to be one of a series of HP stories, “but poor early sales led the Woolfs to limit the series” to just two books, the first being The Empire Builder by Lord Olivier. In a letter of February 1927 to Davies, Leonard Woolf predicted poor sales, but acknowledged the his own and Virginia Woolf’s appreciation of his work nonetheless: “We have been extremely interested by your MS and think it in many ways a remarkable piece of writing. It is hardly likely to have a large sale, but we should much like to publish it,” (HPA, 1927).
Between 1928 and 1948, Davies continued to serve as a lecturer for University College, Bangor.  At the same time, he continued publishing, editing, and reviewing multiple books and essays. In 1928 and 1929, he edited D.G. Rosetti’s “Selections” and two articles, “On Being an Essayist” and “A Glimpse of Mr. Chesterton,” appeared in The Bermondsey Book (Ann Hughes, University College Bangor Archives). On December 9, 1931 Davies was promoted from his probationary position at Bangor to a lecturer of English. A year after this, in 1932, he published a collection of poetry titled Cold Comfort with Noel Douglas publishers in London. This collection is dedicated simply “To Con.”  Con is Constance Bullock-Davies, his wife and fellow lecturer at Bangor in Classics and Modern Languages (http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/).
Bullock-Davies was a lecturer in in the Department of Education between 1953 and 1969. She was one of the foremost researchers on King Arthur. She was also a prolific writer; some of her works include English pronunciation from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century: a handbook to the study of historical grammar (1935), A grain of mustard seed: an account of the founding of the first Women's Institute in Great Britain, with extracts from its minute books (1953),Professional interpreters and the Matter of Britain: a lecture delivered at a colloquium of the Departments of Welsh in the University of Wales at Gregynog, 26th June, 1965 (1966), Menestrellorum multitudo: minstrels at a royal feast (1978), and Register of royal and baronial domestic minstrels 1272-1327 (1986).
        In the 1930s and ‘40s, Davies continued to contribute to and to publish in works such as “The Rape of the Lock and Evelyn’s Mundus Muliebris – a Parallel” (July, 1934) and the Poetry Chronicle in Wales (May, 1948). Another notable contribution during 1945 was Davies’ review of T.S. Eliot’s Four Quarter’s in the journal Wales (Vol, IV no. 6) perhaps born of their earlier correspondence in 1928 (The Letters of T. S. Eliot Volume 4: 1928-1929). By this time, Davies had been promoted yet again at the University College, Bangor to senior lecturer on September 24, 1947. Judging by the correspondence during the ‘30s and ‘40s between Davies and writers like Edwin Muir and W.H Davies, well as publishers like Jonathan Cape, it seems Davies was actively involved in not only producing his own work, but helping others produce and become published as well.  
Davies continued his professorship at Bangor until his death in the summer of 1953. A newspaper article about his death from the archives at University College, Bangor reads: “A cloud was cast over the department in the summer term by the illness and sudden and untimely death of Mr. Charles Davies” (U.C.N.W. Reports of the Heads of Departments for 1951-52 and 1952-53). The high regard for his work and professorship are apparent in the document.

"Ferenc Békássy was born on April 7 1893 in Western Hungary and died on June 25, 1915 fighting on the Eastern Front in WWI (Békássy, p. v).  He was born into the Hungarian aristocracy and his family owned an abundance of land in Western Hungary.  The Békássy family was very liberal, they were known for hiring nannies from all around Europe so as to more easily learn new languages and to see different points of view as well.  Ferenc’s mother, Emma Békássy, was especially progressive.  Influenced by a French article, Emma Békássy decided to send Ferenc, at the age of 12, and his five other siblings to the Bedales School in Dunhurst, a progressive and coeducational school (Gömöri, p. 105-106). 
Here at the Bedales school is where Békássy met Noel Olivier and Rupert Brooke.  Olivier began attending Bedales in 1908, and Békássy became her friend almost immediately.  They continued to talk until his death.  His encounters with Rupert Brooke were not so friendly, as Rupert Brooke was Noel Olivier’s lover and was jealous of Ferenc.  By the time Békássy graduated from the Bedales school in 1911, he was already fluent in English and well on his way to becoming an intellectual.  In fact, in 1909 Békássy gave a lecture to his fellow pupils on Friedrich Nietzsche (Gömöri, p. 107).
After he graduated from the Bedales school he became a scholar at the Kings College of Cambridge.  At King’s, Békássy met John Maynard Keynes, who took an immediate special interest in Békássy.  Békássy made an instant impression and by 1912 he was a part of the Cambridge Apostles.  The Apostles were an esteemed and secretive intellectual group with a membership of only 12, making it hard to get into.  Békássy most likely was incorporated as a member due to the influence of John Maynard Keynes (Gömöri, p. 107-108).  Békássy fit the mold of an Apostle perfectly as a multilingual, progressive, intellectual and poetic Hungarian aristocrat.  
Eventually WWI began and Békássy felt that it was his duty to return to Hungary and fight.  Most likely the reason he chose to return was Hungary’s rivalry with RU.  RU had always wanted to conquer Hungary so as to have access to the Adriatic Sea, and Békássy likely felt a sense of honor and duty to his people as an aristocratic leader, to defend Hungary against the designs of RU (Varga, p. 177).  
Békássy’s prominent social connections to the Hogarth Press and Bloomsbury group were John Maynard Keynes, Noel Olivier and Rupert Brooke. Maynard Keynes, as stated before, took a special interest in Ferenc.  Based on their letters, it is hard to tell if Békássy and Maynard Keynes’ relationship remained platonic the entire time, and it is likely that Békássy was one of Maynard Keynes’ lovers (Gömöri, p. 108). Maynard Keynes even claims to have paid for Békássy’s passage back to Hungary (Varga, p. 172).  If Békássy ever did meet Virginia and/or Leonard Woolf, it was through Maynard Keynes.  Perhaps they met at a party, as there is evidence that Maynard Keynes invited Ferenc to at least one party at the Woolf’s Asheham house (Woolf, p. 47).  After Békássy died, Maynard Keynes talks about Békássy as if he was infatuated with him and seems confused, not understanding why Békássy decided to return to Hungary and fight (Varga, p. 176).  
Olivier and Békássy started off as friends who shared similar interests.  Based on their correspondences, they got along very easily, and as time progressed they seem to have become lovers, as their letters got more and more intimate (Gömöri, p. 107).  Due to his strong relationship with Olivier, his rapport with Rupert Brooke was not so good.  Brooke was a somewhat obsessive and controlling man, and as a lover of Olivier he was fairly jealous of Békássy’s ability to get along so easily with Olivier.  On at least one occasion, Brooke confronted Békássy about his relationship with Olivier.  However, Békássy was mild mannered and did not engage Brooke’s confrontational demeanor.  Due to his jealousy, Brooke portrays Békássy with ill intention in his correspondences (Gömöri, p. 108-109).  
The Adriatica was Békássy’s sole publication through the Hogarth Press.  It was published in 1925 after Békássy’s death.  This was also the same year that Virginia Woolf published her essay The RUn Point of View and Maynard Keynes published his essay A Short View of RU.  Most likely, due to their sudden interest in Eastern European countries, especially RU, John Maynard Keynes decided to impress Békássy’s writings upon Virginia (Varga, p. 175-176), as Békássy represented a more progressive Eastern European point of view that many Western Europeans could relate to.  The Adriatica is perhaps the first example of neoclassism, as it is written in epic style but does not portray all the myth and splendor of the original epics, such as The Illiad (Varga, p. 178).  Békássy states on page 15 of The Adriatica, “But though no glamour there / Of goddesses or heroes well could be, / Yet most distinguished our ship’s company.”
Recently in Hungary, due to the publication of a collection of Békássy’s writings in 2010, there has been a renaissance of early 20th century literature, of which Békássy is one of the major figures (Gömöri, p. 105).  Many scholarly articles have appeared about his life and writings, mostly in Hungarian.  George Gömöri is the leading scholar whose articles on Békássy are in English.

"“Irma led an extraordinary life: a leading member of the German Social Democrat's Youth movement and a supporter of Liebknecht before WW1, she moved to Kentish Town, lived with Peter Petroff from 1913, active member of Kentish Town BSP, opposed the war from a revolutionary perspective, went up to the Clyde with Peter to support the Glasgow working class in their struggle with the wartime government which Maclean and the Petroffs thought could be turned into a revolutionary situation. 
She was interned in Aylesbury concentration camp, liberated by the Russian October revolution, was Radek's deputy in the Communist German POW movement before peace with Germany was secured. 
She urged Stalin to allow the Volga Germans to have their own Soviet Republic in which she became a leading Commissar, worked with her husband for the  Soviet Embassy in Berlin in the 1920s, left the Communist Party over the rise of Stalin and the fall of revolutionary democracy in 1925, and opposed the Nazis as a potential grave threat to the international working class movement from 1930 onwards. Irma also worked with the anti-Nazi underground in the weeks after the Reichstag fire when she and her family were on the run, escaped to Paris and finally got back to England. Little is known of her from 1940 onwards but she supported the war against fascism, opposed the RussoGerman Non-Aggression Pact, supported the Russian invasion of Finland and thought, from the end of 1939, that the Red Army and Soviet Russia would be the decisive factor in defeating Nazi Germany. 
Her eldest child Margaret, later called Millie Margaret, married Laurence Jones in 1944. They were both CP members.”

Winchester College, War Trade Dept (1915) then Treasury; King's College, Cambridge (Economics); Stockbroker; Married Maude Bugge (Norwegian) 1926; Hektor Whaling Co. director.  Published in Harold Nicolson's Action alongside Francis Birrell, Osbert Sitwell, Vita Sackville West and Christopher Isherwood.  Paper by Bjorn Basberg:  ""Keynes, Trouton and the Hector Whaling Company. A Personal and Professional Relationship.""  Abstract: John Maynard Keynes’ activities on the stock market are well known. One company in which he bought stocks was the Hector Whaling Company Ltd., London – a comparatively small and little known company founded in 1928. The director of this company was Rupert Trouton. He had worked with Keynes for the Government during the First World War, was his student at Cambridge, and became a close partner in the City from the 1920s and onwards. The reason why Keynes invested in Hector was obviously his association with Rupert Trouton. The first part of this paper explores briefly the development of the Hector Whaling Company and its origins in Norway. The main part analyses the relationship between Trouton and Keynes. The focus is on their co-operation relating to Hector Whaling, but their relationship regarding various other businesses, as well as on the personal level, is also described. The paper is based on studies of the Keynes archives in Cambridge as well as newly available archives of the Hector company. The analysis provides new insights to the more general question on the motivations and decisions behind Keynes’ stock market investments as well as the internationalization of the whaling industry in the 1920s and 30s.  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2595597",,,1897,1965,"Economist, Stockbroker, Businessman",Male,Rupert Trouton,,,London,GB,,Cape Town,ZA,,,,

"""William Stephen Sanders (1871–1941), who had started work as a farmer’s boy at the age of eleven, was a member of the Battersea branch of the SDF, which had its headquarters at Sydney Hall, York Road. He was elected to the London County Council in 1904 and to Parliament in 1929, and served as Secretary of the Fabian Society from 1914 to 1920. His first meeting with Shaw can be dated to mid-1887 by his reference to Shaw’s controversy with Hyndman, which took the form of letters printed in the Pall Mall Gazette on 7, 11, 12 and 16 May.""
