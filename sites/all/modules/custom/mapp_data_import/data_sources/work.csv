Two Stories,y,6359.jpg,"front cover of ""Two Stories""",E.J. Pratt Library,Penguin Random House Archive and Library,"This first literary publication by the Press consists of a story by Leonard, called ""Three Jews"" and another by Virginia, ""The Mark on the Wall."" As the first book produced by the Press, Two Stories has received a great deal of critical attention since it embodies the collaborative effort between the Woolfs that formed the Press's reputation. It contains four woodcut illustrations by Dora Carrington, who is not credited on the book itself. It also embodies a complete circuit of production undertaken by the Woolfs, everything from the writing of the stories to the making of the books. Leonard did the presswork and Virginia the typesetting, and it is this publication that has given rise to the popular understanding of the Press as a venture, despite the fact that it was one of the only books to have been produced this way.",Virginia Woolf|Leonard Woolf,,,Short Fiction,English,,1917
Prelude,y,4601.jpg,"dust jacket of ""Prelude""",E.J. Pratt Library,Penguin Random House Archive and Library,"The second literary publication of the Press, Prelude was hand-printed by the Woolfs. The cover illustration was a matter of some disagreement. Mansfield provided a block that the Woolfs strongly disliked, so they printed some copies with it and some without. The story itself focuses on family life and is written in the witty and impressionistic style for which Mansfield became known. The single story was later included in Mansfield's collection Bliss and Other Stories, which was published by Constable in 1920.",Katherine Mansfield,,,Short Fiction,English,,1918
Poems by C. N. Sidney Woolf,,,,,,"A commemorative volume containing the poems of Cecil Woolf. Not printed for sale but as a memorial tribute, this is one of the Press's only ""privately printed"" publications and is now extremely rare.",Cecil Nathan Sidney Woolf,,,Poetry,English,,1918
Kew Gardens,,4599.jpg,"dust jacket of ""Kew Gardens""",E.J. Pratt Library,Penguin Random House Archive and Library,"Often praised as one of the quintessential Hogarth Press publications, Woolf's Short Fiction about a walk through Kew Gardens is here adorned with Vanessa Bell's woodcuts. The combination of the art and the writing was thought beautiful and innovative and received a glowing review in the TLS, marking one of the most important successes of the Press's early days.",Virginia Woolf,,,Short Fiction,English,,1919
The Mark on the Wall,y,,,,,This book contains only the title story. It is a separate edition of Virginia Woolf's contribution to Two Stories.,Virginia Woolf,,,Short Fiction,English,,1919
Poems,y,,,,,"Eliot's second book of poetry after Prufrock and Other Observations, which had been published by The Egoist in 1917. This collection contains some of the Sweeney poems, ""Gerontion,"" ""Whispers of Immortality"" and ""Dans le Restaurant"" among others. The book did remarkably well and was out of print by the middle of 1920. A number of Eliot's letters to and about the Woolfs regarding the publication survive and can be found in The Letters of T. S. Eliot (1988).",T. S. Eliot,,,Poetry,English,,1919
The Critic in Judgment or Belshazzar of Baronscourt,,6331.jpg,"front cover of ""The Critic in Judgment or Belshazzar of Baronscourt""",E.J. Pratt Library,Penguin Random House Archive and Library,"This dramatic dialogue provides a kind of comical assessment of the work of the aesthetic critic, although it also contains some of Murry's later more seriously articulated preoccupations with the nature of critical judgment. Murry was himself a prominent critic and the editor for a time of the Athenaeum and was the husband of Katherine Mansfield.",John Middleton Murry,,,Drama,English,,1919
Stories from the Old Testament Retold by Logan Pearsall Smith,y,,,,,"This book is a collection of short prose retellings of ""incidents in the lives of the Old Testament worthies."" (5). The collection aims to offer a ""simple, reverent, but at the same time modern and psychological"" portrayal of Biblical history, for the use of Sunday school students as well as their teachers (5). The psychologizing of Biblical characters seems fairly conjectural, and could potentially classify this as a piece of fictionalized biographical writing not dissimilar in tone and intent from the World-Makers and World-Shakers series",Logan Pearsall Smith,,,Religion,English,,1920
The Story of the Siren,y,,,,,"The Story of the Siren is a single Short Fiction by Forster bound in green Japanese paper. It is a fictional travel narrative in which young man's notebook containing his Fellowship Dissertation falls into the Mediterranean Sea. A local man dives in to rescue it and they form a friendship. The imagery can be fruitfully compared to Woolf's story ""Blue and Green"" in Monday or Tuesday.",E. M. Forster,,,Short Fiction,English,,1920
Paris¬†a Poem,y,4608.jpg,"dust jacket of ""Paris A Poem""",E.J.

Reminiscences of Leo Nicolayevitch Tolstoi,y,,,,,"Gorky's Reminiscences are his own fragmentary notes and observations collected from his time as Tolstoy's friend. He claims in the preface not to have edited or attempted to finish these scraps of biographical insight since he deems them somehow necessarily unfinished. The book provides an interesting example of the use of fragmentary form to convey important insights about character. As a biographer, Gorky is neither hero-worshipping nor vilifying but attempts instead to convey Tolstoi's complexity by resisting simple narrative conclusions.",Maxim Gorky,,,Biography,Russian,,1920
Stories of the East,,6458.jpg,"Dora Carrington, front cover of ""Stories of the East""",E.J. Pratt Library,Gill Coleridge,"A collection of Short Fiction about Leonard's time working in Ceylon, these stories offer a dark picture of colonialism and express a deep unease about the state of international relations under colonial powers. Although the book was published in a small run of about 300 copies and remained out of print until very recently, the stories provide an interesting point of comparison to many of Leonard Woolf's other writings and also to some of the political writings published by the Press",Leonard Woolf,,,Short Fiction,English,,1921
Monday or Tuesday,y,,,,,"A collection of eight of Virginia Woolf's Short Fiction, including ""Blue and & Green,"" ""Monday or Tuesday,"" ""A Haunted House,"" ""The Mark on the Wall,"" ""A Society,"" ""The String Quartet,"" ""An Unwritten Novel"" and ""Kew Gardens,"" this book is one of the worst examples of printing that the Woolfs produced. It was printed at the Prompt Press with Leonard's assistance, and is so badly inked that the woodcut illustrations, designed by Vanessa Bell, bleed through the paper obscuring the text.",Virginia Woolf,,,Short Fiction,English,,1921

The Note-Books of Anton Tchekhov together with Reminiscences of Tchekhov,y,,,,,"A translation and collection of writings from Chekhov's notebooks appearing in this edition for the first time in English, this book also contains reminiscences of Chekhov written by Gorky. The reminiscences take a similar form to those in Gorky's book on Tolstoy. Chekhov's own notes are often aphoristic and funny and the note-books seem to have been part commonplace book, part collection of his own observations. The collection provides a combination of literary remains and reminiscences that was a fairly typical practice in nineteenth century publishing, though the Russian element adds a certain innovation to this book. Chekhov's attitude towards literary biography seems to have been less favourable than Gorky's: ""When I see books, I am not concerned with how the authors loved or played cards; I see only their marvelous works."" (5)",Maxim Gorky,,,Biography,Russian,,1921
Daybreak,y,,,,,"A collection of sad lyric poems following strict rhyme schemes and employing conventional modes of address (ie: the Ode; lots of ""O""). Religious themes are apparent throughout and engagement with some traditional religious verse forms (ie: Liturgy). ""It seems so long that I have been laid up on the shelf / Like a broken cup or a too, too, brittle plate;""",Fredegond Shove,,,Poetry,English,,1922
Jacob's Room,y,jacobsroom_002_front.jpg,"Vanessa Bell, dust jacket of ""Jacob's Room""",Bruce Peel Library,Henrietta Garnett,"Well known as Woolf's frst experimental novel to have been published by the Press, Jacob's Room was published with a dust jacket designed by Vanessa Bell. A second impression of 2000 further copies was issued later in 1922 and later impressions were issued as part of the Uniform Edition (Woolmer 17). A wealth of literary criticism on this novel about the life of Jacob Flanders, as on most of Woolf's other works, exists. An early review in The Guardian wrote in a mostly favourable review that ""doubtless she is something of a cult, and in certain passages you might believe that she is making fun of devotees,"" a statement which indicates something about the fervent following that the Press had by 1922",Virginia Woolf,,,Novel,English,,1922
Karn,y,,,,,"A long fantastical narrative poem written in Cantos and Books. Karn is the hero, who at first is lost at sea and then goes on an adventure to try to find ""the love of mortal men."" He comes upon a peculiar community of religious fanatics (""Red kirtled in black groves the small-lipped priests /Turn to the moon""). When Karn comes upon the ""golden boys"" that the priests have conjured with their chanting, he smites them and upsets the priests. They head back to the village to find that the king is upset with Karn's gallavanting. After a bit of a chat, Karn manages to convince the King that together they can ""free /The people from the priestly lie"" and develop a society with no religion. Then, he meets the princess and she kisses him and falls in love. Karn kisses a slave. Turns out that the princess has a book of sorcery and is actually a shape-shifter, so Karn leaves the village in order to escape her and calls out for help from some elves. An elf turns up to help him and stays with him for nine days until he is ready to go back to the village. He returns to find a slave being beaten by the princess's army of ""Great women with bare bodies and their groins/Aproned in leather."" He decides once and for all that this is too much and that the princess is evil, so he leaves the village again. Book III suddenly switches into second-person, addressing the reader for the first three stanzas. War ensues between the King and his army and Karn. Eventually after the battle, the slave girl is reunieted wtih Karn and they are happy.",Ruth Manning-Sanders,,,Poetry,English,,1922
Beyond the Pleasure Principle,y,,,,,"The Press took over the International Psycho-Analytical Library, edited by Ernest Jones and James Strachey in 1924 from The International Psycho-analytical Press (Woolmer 183). The series had begun in 1921, and the Press acquired the remaining bound and unbound sheets of the first publications. Although there is no evidence (due to the lack of a material imprint) to suggest which of these early bound publications the Press purchased, Woolmer lists the whole series in his Appendix to the Checklist, though he only lists the Hogarth Press imprints (1924 onward) in the Checklist itself.",Sigmund Freud,,C.

The Gentleman from San Francisco and other stories,y,,,,,"A collection of Short Fiction translated from the Russian. The title story was translated by D. H. Lawrence whose name was omitted by mistake and inserted with a correction slip. The stories are on a variety of subjects and are mostly narrated in the third person. Bunin's style (at least as it comes across in translation) is often lyrical and his sentences complex. His endings tend towards elegant imagery: 'The second evening, and the third evening, still they danced, amid a storm that swept over the ocean, booming like a funeral service, rolling up mountains of mourning darkness silvered with foam' (37) but there is always an undercurrent of darkness. In one particularly disturbing tale, 'Gentle Breathing,' in which a teenage girl is raped and then murdered by her rapist.",I. A. Bunin,,,Short Fiction,Russian,,1922
Stavrogin's Confession and The Plan of the Life of a Great Sinner,y,,,,,"A collection of literary remains translated from the Russian, the book contains a note from the Russian government about the discovery of Dostoevsky's papers after his death and the uncovering of the plans for a novel among them. Here the notes towards the novel are included alongside a previously unpublished story.",F. M. Dostoevsky,,,Novel,Russian,,1922
The Autobiography of Countess Sophia Tolstoi,y,y,,,,"Sophia Tolstoy originally wrote her book because it was solicited by a publisher in Russia, S. A. Vegenrov, in 1913. Vegenerov hoped that it might offer insight into the controversy around Tolstoy's last years in which his radically ascetic ideals interfered in serious ways with his family life and caused what subsequent biographers have described as one of the unhappiest marriages in literary history. However, the book was never published, and the text itself was discovered among Vegenrov's papers after his death in 1920. It was subsequently published in Nachala, a Russian review periodical, by Vasilii Spiridonov. The Hogarth Press published the text, again brought to them by Koteliansky, very shortly after the first public appearance of the work in Russia. The short autobiography is framed by a translation of Spiridonov's fairly extensive preface to the Nachala text, a translators' preface written by Leonard Woolf and Koteliansky and a number of notes explaining the contextual details around Sophia Tolstoy's own account of her life and marriage, which were new paratexts for English readers.",Sophia Tolstoy,,,Autobiography,Russian,,1922

His 1908 essay 'Autobiografction,' recently discussed by Max Saunders in his 2010 book, Self Impression, deals directly with the question of hybrid genres at the start of the century and his letters indicate a preoccupation with the relationship between the personal and the fictional. The dust jacket advertises the letters, which have been introduced and selected by Reynolds' friend, as documents that 'give a very vivid picture of his life in Devonshire, of his character, and of the strenuous work which he performed as an Inspector of Fisheries during the war.'",Stephen Reynolds,,,Letters,English,,1923
The Legend of Monte Della Sibilla or Le Paradis de la Reine Sibille,,,,,,"This book, since it was written by Clive Bell, hand-printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and illustrated by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant represents an embodiment of Bloomsbury artistic collaboration. For this reason, it has been described as ""quintessential Bloomsbury"" and grouped alongside the Omega workshop publications of a similar era (Omega Lives 10). The poem itself is a comical retelling of the legend of the Sibyl, an enigmatic mythical fgure who appears in different guises in different literary and classical traditions, but who is usually associated with sorcery and prophecy. Bell's version jokes about the unstable and untrustworthy source material for the myth, extending the mock- challenge that ""It is portentiously ill writ; / Scholars must make the best of it.""",Clive Bell,,,Poetry,English,,1923
A Sampler of Castile,,,,,,"A series of short essays collected from a trip to Spain. Fry writes in the introduction that the book was not intended for his readers but was a personal document and written for himself in order that he might not forget the vivid sensations of his travels. The form of the artist's ""sampler"" is translated into literary terms as a fragmentary form of short collected essays. Fry's introduction indicates a keen awareness of his readership despite the fact that he claims the book wasn't written for the public, and his refections on his travels are often autobiographically self-refexive as he defnes himself in relation to the unfamiliar landscape in which he travels. This is a large format book with illustrations.",Roger Fry,,,Art and Art Criticism,English,,1923
Duncan Grant,,,,,,"Although Woolmer lists no such series in his appendix to his Checklist to the Hogarth Press, and although it appears that no further books exist in the series, Fry's Duncan Grant is described as a ""Living Painters"" book. Fry's study of Grant's art attempts to explain the value of his work. Ultimately, Fry decides that Grant's work is appealing because it is ""entirely natural and unaffected"" and because of its spontaneous and charming character. Fry suggests that Grant's oeuvre itself has a ""personality"" quite apart from that of the artist. The book is listed in the Complete Catalogue of 1939 under Duncan Grant's name, perhaps because the illustration plates are of Grant's own art.",Roger Fry,,,Art and Art Criticism,English,,1923

Bosanquet suggests that this common problem of writing a literary biography, that the subject spends most of his time sitting in a desk, is particularly exacerbated with James, since 'Many men and women whose prime business is the art of writing find rest and refreshment in other occupations.

To friends who urged that its publication would stir up bitter feelings, I point out that the deeds of which it speaks were done, and men's minds securely hold the smouldering memory. Other friends, among them some of the names most honoured in contemporary literature, have urged that the risk be taken. 'Truth has an eternal title to our confession, though we are sure to be sufferers by it.' The book sets out matters that no Indian could, or perhaps should, set out, and I believe that it will change the attitude of every Englishman who reads it to the end.

The book could easily be described as a piece of Travel, though the letters are authentic documents and the book itself not a coherent narrative but a series of separate letters.

Anonymity an Enquiry,,6323.jpg,"Vanessa Bell, dust jacket of ""Anonymity an Enquiry""",E.J. Pratt Library,Henrietta Garnett,"Forster's essay asks the basic question of whether or not people like to know who a book is by. He argues that the fashion for insisting on the relevance of a literary critic's personality is too extreme, and that this is so because there are two levels of personality, one on the surface and one deeper down. The essay has a certain relevance to biographical writing since it suggests that the facts and trivialities of a writer's life can fly out the window when a person is absorbed in reading literature, but also indicates something about the necessity of attempting to portray the deeper aspects of the self. Ultimately, Forster argues that literature does what academic work cannot do, since, he argues, 'Study is only a serious form of gossip. It teaches us everything about the book except the central thing, and between that and us it races a circular barrier, which only the wings of the spirit can cross' (20).",E. M.

The book's title reflects the generic indeterminacy of these short pieces, which range from essays about the ballet, omnibuses and London fashion, to stories about ladies having tea. The pieces, essays and stories alike, share a concern with women's aesthetic sensibilities and gender distinctions more broadly. The extent to which any of this material may or may not be autobiographical is authentically unclear.

Cock Robin's Decease,,,,,,"This book, written by the editor of the ""Sixpenny Poets"" series published by Benn, dicusses the difficulty of publishing poetry following WWI. With a serious attention to matters of the sale and marketing of poetry, Thompson describes what he calls the ""sixpennying"" of poetry as an undervaluing of the genre by a wide public. He sets up the book as what he calls ""An Irregular Inquest"" in which he enacts a trial for the crime of killing poetry. He acquits poets, publishers and the public, and condemns reviewers and their editors. Thompson makes reference to the sad state of publishing new writing, but notes that he can see ""one partial exception"" to his statement that new poets will not be accepted by publishers, but that ""since he is publishing this essay, I cannot say what I think of the poetry he publishes."" Since the essay was not previously published, it can be assumed that he refers to Leonard Woolf. He continues, in a statement that reinforces Leonard's own summaries of the Press's mission: ""(My opinion would be quite respectful, but, in brief, I think his activities here valuable chiefly as a part of his effort towards freedom and freshness of thinking)"" (11).",Edward Thompson,,,Literary Criticism,English,,1928
